## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is a version control system that allows us to store code in the cloud, keep track 
of our changes to our code over time, and allows us to work with other developers.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a set of commands to code while GitHub is where we store our code.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
We create a branch to work on our specific problems like a feature or bug then be able 
to merge it back into the main branch. It will help us be able to track back if the 
same bug comes back up again.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
The purpose of a pull request is to get the code you were working on put into the main 
branch.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
The command you would use to switch between branches is git branch -M and the command to get back to the main branch is git branch -M main. You can also double check 
which branch you are currently in with the command git branch.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
Git fetch command fetches updates but does not merge them. Git merge command will combine 2 branches. Git pull command pulls down from a remote and instantly merges.

7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when you try to merge branches that have competing commits.
 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
To resolve a merge conflict you will need a new commit to solve the competing commits.
